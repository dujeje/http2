# HTTP/2 Performance Demonstration

## Overview

This project showcases the efficiency of the HTTP/2 protocol over HTTP/1.x in web content delivery. Using a custom-configured Nginx server, the project demonstrates the speed advantages of HTTP/2, particularly in the loading of web pages with numerous resources.

## Project Highlights

- **HTTP/2 vs. HTTP/1.x**: Compares the loading times of a web page under both protocols to highlight the performance benefits of HTTP/2.
- **Optimized Web Page**: Features a specially designed web page with multiple CSS, JS, and image files to emphasize the efficient loading capabilities of HTTP/2.
- **Performance Analysis**: Includes browser console screenshots and HAR files to provide a clear comparison between the two protocols.
- **Practical Demonstration**: Utilizes a real web server environment to give a hands-on experience of the HTTP/2 protocol's impact on web page loading speed.
